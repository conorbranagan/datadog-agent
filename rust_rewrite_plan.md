# Rust Rewrite Plan for Datadog Agent

## Introduction
This document outlines the plan for rewriting the Datadog Agent in Rust, aiming to achieve compatibility and feature parity with the original Go implementation.

## Core Components
- Collector: Responsible for the lifecycle of checks, including creation, scheduling, and running.
- Aggregator: Manages metric aggregation before sending it to the Datadog platform.
- Scheduler: Handles the timing and execution of checks at specified intervals.
- Check: Defines the interface and types for checks that the agent runs.

## Concurrency Model
- Rust's async/await will be used to handle asynchronous operations.
- The Tokio runtime will be chosen for managing asynchronous tasks, timers, and I/O operations.

## Data Structures and Interfaces
- Mapping Go structures to Rust equivalents, ensuring type safety and efficient memory management.
- Implementing interfaces using Rust traits.

## Error Handling
- Leveraging Rust's `Result` and `Option` types for error handling to replace Go's `if err != nil` pattern.

## Configuration Management
- Utilizing Rust crates for YAML parsing to load and manage configurations.
- Ensuring all configurations are strongly typed and validated at compile-time.

## Dependency Management
- Using Cargo for managing Rust dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.

## Testing Strategy
- Writing extensive unit and integration tests using Rust's testing framework.
- Ensuring all tests are run in the CI/CD pipeline before merging code changes.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the Rust version of the agent.
- Integrating linters and formatters to enforce code quality and style.

## Documentation
- Documenting the architecture, design decisions, and usage examples.
- Providing inline documentation for public APIs and complex logic.

## Licensing
- Reviewing all dependencies for compatibility with the Apache License 2.0 and GPL 2.0.

## Milestones
1. Set up Rust project structure and tooling.
2. Implement core components in Rust.
3. Integrate Rust components with the existing agent ecosystem.
4. Test Rust components in a staging environment.
5. Deploy the Rust version of the agent to production.

## Conclusion
The Rust rewrite of the Datadog Agent will focus on safety, performance, and maintainability, leveraging Rust's strong type system and concurrency model.
